Candidate Elimination is a machine learning algorithm used for concept learning and hypothesis generation in the context of supervised learning. 
It is a simple yet effective algorithm that operates by maintaining and updating two sets of hypotheses: the most specific hypothesis (S) and the most general hypothesis (G). These sets represent the boundaries of the concept space.

1.Initialization:
At the beginning, the specific hypothesis (S) is set to the most specific hypothesis possible (usually represented as a set of constraints on attribute values), and the general hypothesis (G) is set to the most general hypothesis possible (usually represented as all possible attribute values).

2.Iterative Refinement:
For each training example:
If the example is classified as positive:
    Generalize the specific hypothesis (S) to cover the positive example, if possible, by relaxing constraints.
    Remove from the general hypothesis (G) any instances inconsistent with the positive example.
If the example is classified as negative:
    Specialize the general hypothesis (G) to exclude the negative example, if possible, by adding constraints.
    Remove from the specific hypothesis (S) any instances consistent with the negative example.
    
3.Termination:
Continue iterating through the training examples until convergence, where either:
    S and G converge to a single hypothesis, or
    No more updates are possible (indicating the concept cannot be learned with the given hypothesis space).
    
4. Output:
The final hypothesis space is defined by the most specific hypothesis (S) and the most general hypothesis (G) after convergence.

Characteristics:
Completeness: Candidate Elimination guarantees to find the correct hypothesis if it exists within the hypothesis space.
Efficiency: It is computationally efficient, especially for small hypothesis spaces and datasets.
Assumptions: Candidate Elimination assumes that the target concept can be represented within the specified hypothesis space and that the training data is noise-free.
